# 🧠 Employee Attrition Prediction – Mohammed AlDiri

A machine learning project that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave a company using the IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset. This project applies preprocessing, visual analysis, and a Random Forest model to provide insights into employee retention. It also includes a feature that allows you to test predictions on custom employee data.
